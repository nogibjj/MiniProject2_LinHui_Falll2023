This repo runs a main function of Pandas descriptive stats, with numpy version 1.25.1, and pandas version 2.1.0.


First thing to do on launch is to open a new shell and verify virtualenv is sourced.

Things included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Pytest`

* `pandas`

* `Ruff`:  

Run `make lint` which runs `ruff check`.  You can find out more info on [Ruff here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

* `Dockerfile`

* `GitHub copilot`

* `jupyter` and `ipython` 

* A base set of libraries for devops and web
